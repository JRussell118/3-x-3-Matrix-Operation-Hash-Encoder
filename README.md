# 3-x-3-Matrix-Operation-Hash-Encoder
### This program reads and validates a phone number and zipcode from the user,
and performs the specified operation with two 3x3 matrices from the user.
This project was consisted of two programs, a 3x3 matrix operation program and a hash encoder program. The matrix program takes and validates a phone number and zipcode, then prompts the user for two 3x3 matrices. The program then prompts the user for an operation to perform on the matrices and displays the operation result, the transpose matrix, and the means of the values in the rows and columns. The hash encoder takes a string from the user and uses Python's hashlib library to encode it using three hashing functions.

><h1>Building Secure Python Applications</h1>
><h2>SDEV 300</h2>
><p>A hands-on study of best practices and strategies for building secure Python desktop and web applications. The objective is to design and build Python applications that are resistant to common security threats. Topics include syntax, data structures, style guides, data munging, web application frameworks, and the use of secure coding tools and processes to guard against application vulnerabilities.</p>
